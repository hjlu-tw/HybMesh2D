# Three reference cases from the solver's own grids

**A RESEARCH NOTE, and three EXEMPLARS.** Companion to
`jaxa-30p30n-reference-mesh.md`, which took one externally-produced mesh apart. This one does
the same for the three cases in `Mesh_Gary/` (outside this repo, alongside it), because they
are what this group's solver is actually fed and so they are what "a good mesh" has to mean
here. Nothing is binding; no rule, gate or source file was changed to write it. 2026-10-15.

The three are not one standard. **They are three different ones**, and the first useful thing
they say is that a single quality target would be wrong for all three.

## The `.grid` format, deduced

No reader existed. The layout below is the only one whose arithmetic closes **to the byte** on
both files, and `tools/scripts/read_solver_grid.py` reads it:

```
int32   version (1), ncell, nvert, nbface
ncell  x (int32 k, int32 node[k])     k = 3 in both cases; nodes are 0-based
nvert  x (double x, double y)
nbface x (int32 nodeA, nodeB, cell)   the third int names the OWNER CELL --
                                      verified on 200 of 200 sampled faces
```

The companion `.bc` is ASCII: its first line names the `.bc.def`, then one line per boundary
face giving `face_index segment_no`. `.bc.def` maps `segm_no` to a `bc_flag`, and a flag may
carry a parameter (`4    3  4.622` in the cone's).

## Case 1 — `schardin`: an ISOTROPIC mesh, and no boundary layer at all

461,858 triangles, 232,375 vertices, 2,890 boundary faces, over x ∈ [−5, 9.232], y ∈ [0, 5]
(the half plane; y = 0 is the symmetry line).

| | |
|---|---|
| body | a 30° wedge: (0, 0) → (1.7321, 0) → (1.7321, 1), apex upstream |
| boundary segments | 0: the symmetry line, 1,270 faces · 1: the outer boundary, 810 · 2: the wedge, 810 |
| **edge ratio** | **median 1.170, p95 1.454, max 4.218** |
| cell edge | median 0.0167, p95 0.0330, max 0.0481 |
| near the wedge | 66,895 cells at a mean edge of 0.0073 |
| downstream (x > 5) | 86,469 cells at 0.0238 |
| wedge surface | face length 0.0036, first cell 0.0015 — a ratio of 2.4, not 40 |

**The indicator: near-equilateral everywhere, and a size that varies by about 3× over the whole
domain.** There is no boundary layer and no anisotropy — this is an inviscid shock-diffraction
problem, where what the scheme needs is isotropy at the shock, not resolution at the wall.
A mesher that always grows a boundary layer would be wrong here by construction.

## Case 2 — `vki-cone`: wall-resolved, strongly graded

528,000 triangles, 265,341 vertices, 2,680 boundary faces, over x ∈ [−10, 159.11],
y ∈ [0, 50].

| | |
|---|---|
| body | the cone, segment 4: (0, 0) → (159.11, 37.5), with a blunt nose (points at x = 0 up to y = 0.013) |
| boundary segments | 1: inflow x = −10, 170 faces · 2: outer, 1,170 · 3: the axis ahead of the cone, 240 · 4: the cone, 1,100 |
| **edge ratio** | **median 3.376, p95 34.205, max 80.589** |
| cell edge | median 0.136, p95 0.310, max 0.571 |
| wall first cell | 0.0020 at the nose, 0.0031–0.0042 along the cone |
| wall surface spacing | 0.0040 at the nose, 0.074–0.195 along the cone |
| wall cell aspect | 2 at the nose, 18–80 along the cone |

**The indicator: a first cell of 2–4 × 10⁻³ against a body 159 long — about 2 × 10⁻⁵ of the
body — carried by triangles whose aspect ratio reaches 80.** The nose is the exception and it
is deliberate: there the surface spacing collapses to the first-cell height, so the cells are
isotropic exactly where the stagnation gradients are.

## Case 3 — `30P30N_jaxa`

Taken apart in `jaxa-30p30n-reference-mesh.md`: 20 structured body-fitted ribbons about 1.5 %
chord deep inside 1.01 M unstructured triangles, the far field capped and nested.

## What the three together say

1. **The quality target is a property of the PHYSICS, not of the mesher.** Edge ratio median
   1.17 is right for `schardin` and would be unreachable (and pointless) for `vki-cone`, whose
   median is 3.38 and whose p95 is 34.
2. **Two of the three have no structured region at all.** The one that does is the one with a
   boundary layer AND a geometry whose features (coves, slots) need blocks.
3. **All three are triangles in the end.** Whatever the construction, the solver is fed an
   unstructured triangular grid with an explicit boundary-face list naming the owner cell —
   which is the shape this repo's STAR-CD export already has, under other names.
